## Overview

This is a GitHub Pages template based on Just the Class, developed for the purpose of quickly deploying course overview websites. Such websites link to previous course offerings, provide a summary of what the course is about, and may list learning goals and prerequisites. This paragraph would normally be replaced by an overview of a specific course, and could include information from the [Berkeley Academic Guide](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/).
